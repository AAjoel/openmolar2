Welcome to the technical documentation for OpenMolar.

.. note::
    
 These documents described in technical language how the application is designed and how the design is implemented.
 
 
 In addition, all python classes used by the application have been catalogued using autodoc. This has proved so useful, that the index to these documents is permalinked in the top right corner of every technical page here.
 
 
 - *DESIGN* :doc:`design/index`
 
 - *IMPLEMENTATION* :doc:`implementation/index`
 
 - *CLASSES* :doc:`classes/classindex`
