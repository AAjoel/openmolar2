To install openmolar, it is highly advised to use packages built for your OS.

However, the instructions from source are as follows.

ensure dependencies are met for the components you wish to install

client deps
 - python2.* (>=2.5)         http://www.python.org/        
 - python-mysqldb            http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/
 - python-qt4                http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro
 - qt4                       http://qt.nokia.com/

language pack deps
(mo files are converted to binary po files and installed in /usr/share/locale, and some plugin dialogs go into the openmolar client)
 
 - gettext                   http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/
