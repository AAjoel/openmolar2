server should be able to supply it's log file (on request) to the admin app.
    DONE!

use apgdiff.
    when the server package is installed, database template should be updated and dumped to 
    /var/lib/openmolar/schema_dump_VERSION.sql
    apgdiff can then be called on ny schema to check if it conforms.

More functionality for openmolar-server?
    examples 

    openmolar_server --create_demo
    openmolar_server --create_user neil
    openmolar_server -h 127.0.0.1 -p 230 -u admin -p password --check_schema openmolar_demo
