NEW ISSUES
======================================================================

2012_09_08 - Client Needs Some love.
    time to get the client functionality up towards om1 functionality.


2012_09_08 - Client Save changes.
    changes are being noticed correctly, but not applied.
    Address changes, notes etc.

2012_09_08 - Client Alter/set regular clinicians.

2012_09_08 - Client and Admin:
    Plugin Directories.
    Let's just go for /etc/share/openmolar/plugins and ~/.openmolar2
    or suchlike.
    each plugin enabled should be saved with qsettings?

    DONE 2012_09_12 ... needs testing.

2012_09_08 - Client:
    Set User1 and User2.

2012_09_08 - Client - Reception Page
    let's throw up dialogs for take payment and make appointment.

2012_09_08 - Client - Summary Page
    hygienist and examination dialogs act differently.
    hygienist treatment doesn't recognise the clinician set.


2012_08_29 - admin app session toolbar.
    move to the session tab! will be much more intuitive.

2012_08_01 - use apgdiff.
    when the server package is installed, database template should be updated and dumped to
    /var/lib/openmolar/schema_dump_VERSION.sql
    apgdiff can then be called on ny schema to check if it conforms.

2012_08_01 - More functionality for openmolar-server?
    examples

    openmolar_server --create_demo
    openmolar_server --create_user neil
    openmolar_server -h 127.0.0.1 -p 230 -u admin -p password --check_schema openmolar_demo


2012_08_01 - Fix FuzzyMatch Shell script
    uses version 8.4 :(

2012_08_01 - Icons.
    om_admin uses a lot of icons fromTheme... see it running under e17 to
    understand the problem. Ideally I need to provide a backup theme.

======================================================================
FIXED ISSUES
======================================================================
2012_09_08 - Client update clinial memo:
    this throws an AttributeError
    'lib_openmolar/client/qt4/interfaces/patient_interface.py', line 450 in load_patient
    if not self.ok_to_leave_record:
    NB clerical memo works fine!
    "close without saving" doesn't seem to work either!

    FIXED 2012_09_17. errors were being obscured by a class property

2012_09_08 - Client - BPE
    query needs tweaking.. it doesn't always get the most recent
    DONE 2012_09_17

2012_09_08 - Client - TM and AT
    these throw an error 'ChartLineEdit' object has no attribute 'finished_edit'
    DONE 2012_09_12

2012_09_08 - Client Save New Patient.
    getting key errors. this used to work.

    FIXED 2012_09_11 - the issue was import function doesn't update the patients_ix_seq.
    not possible to do this with the importer user as insufficient perms, so added a server function to do this.

2012_08_22 - server log is doubling up
    fix it!
    DONE 2012_08_30

2012_08_22 - get configuration link working for admin app
    suggest that at the very least this shows the text which needs to be
    saved as a config file, and suggests a name etc.
    DONE 2012_08_29


2012_08_22 - admin app should allow addition of postgres users.
    add a login user to postgres, and control where they can login from ?
    DONE 2012_08_29

2012_08_22 - add server function "user permissions" to the management dialog
    this should show the users and their current groups, and allow removal and addition to those groups.
    DONE 2012_08_29


2012_08_12 - add a save html button to the admin browser
    (this will speed development of css etc)
    DONE 2012_08_21

2012_08_12 - admin welcome html should show more information about the postgres server
    (eg. version number, users etc...)
    DONE 2012_08_21

2012_08_01 - server should be able to supply it's log file (on request) to the admin app.
    DONE 2012_08_08

2012_08_01 - Run om_sphinx and postgresql_autodoc
    DONE! 2012_08_14

2012_08_01 - New Design for ManageDatabaseDialog
    this should get a list of functions from the server,
    and offer them to the user.

    1.  give the server a new function - "admin_options". this function
        should return a set of objects which give the name of the function
        to be called, warnings (eg.. this will remove all data etc..)
        - on second thoughts.. perhaps just the function names, and then assume the server also has a doc_function?
        - eg.. server.drop_database and server.drop_database_warnings ?
    2.  make the dialog display these options and call them.
    3.  existing functions (drop database, remove all data, manage users a good place to start)
    4.  also.. how about "check schema version", and "update schema version".


    DONE! 2012_08_14
