Installation Instructions
=========================

:Author: Neil Wallace neil@openmolar.com

Openmolar-server will only run on a Gnu/Linux (or BSD?) operating system.

The Admin and Client components will run on windows, although supporting this 
platform is low priority for me.

.. note:
   No official release (even alpha) has been made as yet.
