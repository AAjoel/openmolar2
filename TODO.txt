NEW ISSUES

======================================================================
20.8.2012
add a save html button to the admin browser
    (this will speed development of css etc)

admin welcome html should show more information about the postgres server
    (eg. version number, users etc...)

======================================================================

use apgdiff.
    when the server package is installed, database template should be updated and dumped to 
    /var/lib/openmolar/schema_dump_VERSION.sql
    apgdiff can then be called on ny schema to check if it conforms.

More functionality for openmolar-server?
    examples 

    openmolar_server --create_demo
    openmolar_server --create_user neil
    openmolar_server -h 127.0.0.1 -p 230 -u admin -p password --check_schema openmolar_demo


Fix FuzzyMatch Shell script
    uses version 8.4 :(
    
Icons.
    om_admin uses a lot of icons fromTheme... see it running under e17 to
    understand the problem. Ideally I need to provide a backup theme.

FIXED ISSUES

server should be able to supply it's log file (on request) to the admin app.
    DONE 2012_08_08

Run om_sphinx and postgresql_autodoc

New Design for ManageDatabaseDialog
    this should get a list of functions from the server, 
    and offer them to the user.

    1.  give the server a new function - "admin_options". this function
        should return a set of objects which give the name of the function
        to be called, warnings (eg.. this will remove all data etc..)
        - on second thoughts.. perhaps just the function names, and then assume the server also has a doc_function?
        - eg.. server.drop_database and server.drop_database_warnings ?
    2.  make the dialog display these options and call them.
    3.  existing functions (drop database, remove all data, manage users a good place to start)
    4.  also.. how about "check schema version", and "update schema version".
