The diary for openmolar is a model/view design.

This is the model.

A view will call the data function, with the view style as an argument.
Views will, be design, require a different level of data complexity. 
For instance, if viewing an entire year, an overview as opposed to to the minute detail
is required. When viewing a single day, the converse may be true.
