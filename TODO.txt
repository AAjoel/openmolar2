server should be able to supply it's log file (on request) to the admin app.
    DONE!

use apgdiff.
    when the server package is installed, database template should be updated and dumped to 
    /var/lib/openmolar/schema_dump_VERSION.sql
    apgdiff can then be called on ny schema to check if it conforms.

More functionality for openmolar-server?
    examples 

    openmolar_server --create_demo
    openmolar_server --create_user neil
    openmolar_server -h 127.0.0.1 -p 230 -u admin -p password --check_schema openmolar_demo

New Design for ManageDatabaseDialog
    this should get a list of functions from the server, 
    and offer them to the user.
    
    1.  give the server a new function - "admin_options". this function
        should return a set of objects which give the name of the function
        to be called, warnings (eg.. this will remove all data etc..)
        - on second thoughts.. perhaps just the function names, and then assume the server also has a doc_function?
        - eg.. server.drop_database and server.drop_database_warnings ?
    2.  make the dialog display these options and call them.
    3.  existing functions (drop database, remove all data, manage users a good place to start)
    4.  also.. how about "check schema version", and "update schema version".
    
    
Run om_sphinx and postgresql_autodoc
